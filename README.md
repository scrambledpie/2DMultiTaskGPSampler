# 2DMultiTaskGPSampler
In order to create synthetic test functions for various purposes (such as benchmarking Bayesian Optimisation algortihms), this code can can create simple visualisable functions.

Also the functions are genereated in pairs and a specified correlations, rho, can be set such that when one function is high, the other funciton can be similarly high/low/independent at the same input.
